[Qalsadi](https://github.com/linuxscout/qalsadi) library is a specialized tool for morphological analysis of Arabic texts. It uses a lexical database to analyze fully or partially vocalized texts, providing both morphological analysis and diacritics. Additionally, it evaluates the frequency of word usage in contemporary Arabic and uses the "Qutrub" tool for verb conjugation.
