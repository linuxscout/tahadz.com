[Naftawayh](https://github.com/linuxscout/naftawayh)
Naftawayh is a python library for Arabic word tagging (word classification) into types (nouns, verbs, stopwords), which is useful in language processing, especially for text mining. Naftawayh works according to the Arabic word structure, and the ability to guess the word class, through certain signs. For example, a word which ends Teh Marbuta, is a noun. Hamza Below Alef, class the word as a noun. We can identify many kins of words, by patterns especially for verbs in present tense and defined words.
