[Knashti application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.konashati.app): To search for terms based on specialized dictionaries issued by the High Council of the Arabic Language in Algeria, and the application facilitates searching for terms instead of printed dictionaries,

The application has three dictionaries so far: Library Guide, Financial and Accounting Management Guide and Mechanical Equipment Guide.

It also allows you to add new personal terms for later use. Like the small notebook in which you used to save the new words you learn in a foreign language.
